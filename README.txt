A no chemicals, calories, floatation tank, std or alchohol stress reliever experiment.


A simple relaxation tool, kinda like TM in the 70's only visual.
You just watch it for a while. Simple yet complex. It's a  short mindNap you can 
take to destress while riding the Subway, in a cofee shop or at your desk.
Not for walking or driving or hell no, while operating heavy equipment.
You'll look normal - staring at a cell phone. But you should be unwinding.
Based on the theme that the earth couldn't possibly be flat since we live in a 3D World.
And so it must be a Cube. 
Made with the UNITY Game engine.
No animal testing.
Sequence of demo photos included.
